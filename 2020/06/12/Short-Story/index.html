        <p>The invisible man</p>
<p>The audience around me suddenly screamed. I also heard the conversation between the two students near me. </p>
<p>“Why is he suddenly appear on the stage?” One student asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about that, maybe it’s a new way to come on the stage,” The other one answered, “As long as I can hear him sing on the stage, I will cheer for him.”<br>  The boy on the stage clearly saw what was happening. I noticed that the fear in his bloodshot eyes finally subsided, and the tense facial muscles relaxed. His pearly tears flowed from his eyes, and the sunshine smile finally came back to his face again.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Suomaf.” I said to myself. Seeing that he could be seen by the students again, I finally let go of my worries. The strange phenomenon of these days was over.</p>
<p>The boy’s name was Suomaf. He and I were both two students in Erwin high school. Compared with me, Soumaf was much more eye-catching. He was like the only flower on the lawn: his face was bright and white with sharp edges and corners. The thick eyebrows rose a little rebelliously. Under the long and curly eyelashes, a pair of sapphire like bright eyes were inlaid in the eye socket. Lips were as tender as rose petals. On the other hand, He had a great interest and talent for singing. Every time there was a singing activity holding in the school, he always appeared on the stage. As soon as his voice came out in the hall, the room was accompanied by waves of cheers and applause. And I was one of the cheers for him. My name was Lamron and I was a common student in this school. However, I was his best friend and we had known each other since Primary school.</p>
<p>Because of the heavy task of high school study, it was difficult for him to squeeze out time to rehearse all kinds of activities arranged by the teachers. Since grade 11 began, I had found that he slept more and more in class during the day, and often couldn’t control his mood.</p>
<p>He complains more and more about his life now. He is no longer willing to communicate with other people; He is dismissive or dismissive of the teacher’s request; Almost all his talks with his parents ended in a quarrel. Just last Thursday, his discontent finally broke out.</p>
<p>“I really don’t want to be a star on campus anymore,” he shouted to me. “Classmates, teachers and schools all have very high requirements for me. I can’t stand for such pressure any more. Every day, we should not only provide homework samples, but also participate in various activities. Every time there is a small mistake, the teacher says it all the time!”</p>
<p>His eyes were full of fatigue and disappointment. The original two shiny gems had been buried in the dust. Those two petals seemed to have passed their most dazzling moment and withered slowly. Even the hair was tarnished and piled up like withered bushes.</p>
<p>“I have tired with this kind of life now. I do not want to be pay attention to. I hope one body can see me so that I can enjoy my own world.” He said in low voice. Then he raised his feeble hands and waved goodbye to me.</p>
<p>The next morning, he and I met at the school gate as usual. He still looked extremely haggard and depressed.  </p>
<p>“Good morning, Suomaf.” I greeted him warmly. “Do you feel better today? It’s nearly the end of the term. Hold on a little longer. “</p>
<p>“Good morning,” he replied weakly. “I wish I could end this kind of life soon.”</p>
<p>When he was finished speaking, a man hit him hard from back. </p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir?” Suomaf turned discontentedly to look behind him. Surprisingly, the student walked straight past, as if nothing had happened. This made Suomaf angry. He rushed to take the classmate’s arm. However, the student seemed to feel nothing and still walked forward, and Suomaf did not have any effect no matter how hard he tried to pull the student. </p>
<p>I was stunned by this magical phenomenon.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Can’t he see Suomaf? “ I said. “Wait, this student …cannot ‘see’ him?” I reminded what he said yesterday. </p>
<p>“Is his wish has come true? That’s unbelievable.” I said to myself.</p>
<p>I ran to Suomaf and told him what I thought.</p>
<p>“It’s unlikely to happen,” he said with eyes full of doubt. “I want to test it again.”</p>
<p>He chose a student at random and stood in front of him. As a result, the student ran into Suomaf and walked straight on without looking back. Then he tried several more times. He even made faces in front of the security guards, but they didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“It looks like it’s true. I’m invisible.” He couldn’t believe what happened. </p>
<p>“It seems that my wish comes true! I can finally live a normal life,” he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>All day long he was studying this phenomenon. According to his description, only several other friends of him and me could still see him.</p>
<p>On our way home from school, I saw that he had got rid of decadence and despair. He told me he would enjoy this wonderful world. </p>
<p>The only sound on this street was the sound of leaves swaying in the wind. The path which was over hundreds of meters was totally empty and silence, the whole world seemed to be left with him and me. After waving goodbye, I watched him disappear into the silent street, and I have an unknown premonition in my heart.</p>
<p>“There must be something wrong with it,” I said.</p>
<p>I didn’t hear from him until early Sunday morning, I was awakened by the telephone ring. I rubbed my bleary eyes and opened my phone. It was Suomaf.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Suomaf?” I said.</p>
<p>The sound on the other side of the phone took all my sleepiness away.</p>
<p>“Is that Lamron there? That’s great! I am now in big trouble, big trouble!” He cried hysterically. “Do you remember what happened on Friday? Now it’s out of control! Not only the students at school can’t see me, but also other people can’t see me gradually! When I was out shopping on Saturday, I found this problem. Security guards, cashiers and everyone else could not see me! I told my parents about it that day. They tried to ask doctors and friends who used to know me for help, but none of them could see me or remember me!” </p>
<p>His emotions poured down on me like the flood which broken the dyke-dam.</p>
<p>“What’s more, this morning even my parents could not remember either! I heard my parents argued about why there was something in their house that didn’t belong to them – they were my daily necessities! “</p>
<p>When I heard what he said, I completely frozed. I didn’t know what to say to him.</p>
<p>“It’s OK, Suomaf, try to calm down. I’ll figure out a way to help you out. Give me some time to think about it. I will call you later.” I said.</p>
<p> It’s seven o’clock in the morning. The sun might just emerge from the horizon. The world was still shrouded in silky mist. At this time, the outside world seemed so mysterious and oppressive.</p>
<p>I spent the whole morning studying this magical phenomenon. After I had a general idea based on Suomaf’s behavior and thoughts in recent weeks, I called him back.</p>
<p>“Is that Suomaf there?” I asked</p>
<p>“Yes, this is Suomaf speaking. Do you have any suggestions to me?” His voice sounds a little hoarse, perhaps because he cried too much.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have some ideas. I think you’re responsible for all these things happened. Do you remember the time you started to complain about your life stress?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and that has been started for a long time.” </p>
<p>“In my opinion, what you did last couple weeks has created an ‘atmosphere’ which is you do not want to be observed by other people. For instance, you decreased the time you communicate with your classmates and sometimes you do not even respond to them, right? You also tried to avoid talking with teachers. All of these actions created a feeling that you tried to isolated yourself. As a result, people begin to feel this atmosphere so that they do not talk to you. The stronger you want to avoid the people around you, the weaker your sense of presence stays in their mind. When your dissatisfaction reaches the extreme, they may forget you. As the people in our school entre the society, they will bring this atmosphere to others. This may spread faster and faster. Like now.” </p>
<p>“Well, that sounds reasonable.” I heard his tone had softened a lot. </p>
<p>“Then according to your analysis, if I want to go back to my original life, I have to break the atmosphere I created myself?” He asked.</p>
<p>“I think so. You need to show your willingness to your origin life. Do you remember there will be a singing activity on next Monday? It is a chance try whether my method works.”</p>
<p>To my surprise, he showed hesitation.</p>
<p>“Let me consider it for some time.” He faltered in reply.</p>
<p>From his hesitant tone, I knew immediately what he was worried about. In such a critical situation, I decided to point out his problem directly.</p>
<p>“I know that you really like acting. I am sure you know it is normal to have a lot of pressure to make outstanding achievements in your favorite field. You can look at me, suomaf. I’m just an ordinary student. I am struggling getting good grades to apply for university. I’m also under pressure. So I think that since you decide to be a famous singer or star, you have the responsibility to undertake the pressure. This is inevitable. Moreover, if my conjecture is correct, there will be no one remember you in the future. I can’t guarantee that I will remember you forever! Maybe tomorrow I may forget you, too! Wake up, Suomaf! If you don’t break the atmosphere, you will not exist! “ I shouted to him.</p>
<p>Total silence.</p>
<p>“Suomaf? Are you there?” I asked.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“I really want to help you, Suomaf. That’s what all I can do for you. Please have a try, I am the best friend of you.”</p>
<p>“OK.” His voice came from cell phone. “I do not want to die in this way, I still want to be a famous singing star in my future life. The happiest time in my life is when I am singing. I will have a try. Thank you, Lamron. Thank you for saving me.” He said. I could tell the determination from his tone of voice.</p>
<p>“That’s great, my friend. I will I’ll help you write your name on the activity list. Don’t give up this chance.” I said.</p>
<p>Monday afternoon’s event was coming soon, and I encouraged him backstage until he performed.      </p>
<p>“Don’t be nervous, Suomaf. As usual, you will succeed.” I encouraged him. </p>
<p>“Next, we welcome Suomaf and his song <Exist>“ The host said. This song he wrote last two days and he decided to sing it today.</p>
<p> At the beginning, though, everyone looked at the stage confused because they couldn’t see Suomaf. However, the miracle happened. As he became more emotionally engaged, his voice began to appear in the hall. Soon his whole body appeared on the stage. When he appeared, everyone seemed to remember who he was, and the familiar cheers echoed in the hall again.</p>
<p>“My friend lit the last torch for me, help me break the darkness, break myself.” He finished the last sentence and made a deep bow to the audience. </p>
<p>All the spotlights on the ceiling hit him. But what shined more in my eyes than the dazzling lamp was his confident smile and enthusiastic eyes.</p>
