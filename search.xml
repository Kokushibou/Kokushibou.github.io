    <title>Education in Holocaust</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Education’s role in the Holocaust<br>Changes in education will affect an entire generation. Since Hitler takes complete<br>control of Germany, he has made a thorough reform of the education system for minors.<br>First of all, Hitler only allows male students to go to formal school because He wants his<br>students to join the army after graduation. Moreover, he turns the school into a military<br>training camp. In this way, he can carry out military management and education for young<br>people. (Sigward) At the same time, Hitler introduces a lot of racial discrimination in<br>schools. In his books, he portrays Jews as sinners in the world. He also isolates all students<br>of Jewish origin from other students. Hitler does not allow “Aryan” to come into contact<br>with “non-Aryan”. (Sigward) Therefore, Hitler’s reconstruction of the education system<br>makes education play the most role in promoting Holocaust by ensuring the total blind<br>loyalty of children, strengthening their hatred of Jews, and removing their ability to have<br>empathy.<br>First off, Hitler’s style of education stiffens Children’s minds to make them be total<br>loyalty. From the rules made by Dr. Bernhard Rust: decrees that in Nazi schools the norm is<br>physical edulearly shows that. (Sigward) In this course system, the key to judging whether<br>the students are excellent enough is their sport scores. If students spend a lot of time on<br>exercise, they don’t have enough time to study other subjects. Such a monotonous course<br>selection seriously affects the wide range of knowledge learned by students. Under the<br>influence of the concept of sports priority, students will have no interest and ability in<br>learning other content. At that time, students are like a group of robots. Although they are<br>strong physically, they are mentally empty and easy to be led by a certain person or an idea.<br>Hitler understands this very well. He publicizes Nazi superiority through various forms of<br>expression, such as radio, drama, film, art, church, especially schools. In March 1933, he<br>issues the first education law, stipulating that “German culture must be treated thoroughly”.<br>(Graham) Another evidence is geography had become geopolitics. In every moment of<br>school, you can see the words about the superiority of Nazis. (Graham) Such an exaggerated<br>way of education making these students with spiritual emptiness engrave with the thought of<br>“I’m proud to fight for the Nazis”. They are no longer interested in accepting or learning real<br>history and facts. In their eyes, Hitler is God and Nazi is their faith. Through these actions,<br>Hitler successes in ossifying the thoughts of this generation of students and making them his<br>tools. These students are so ruthless when they see the Jews being slaughtered because they<br>think they are doing correct things. They can’t judge right from wrong. They will do<br>whatever Hitler says.<br>In education, Hitler not only publicizes himself and the Nazi party, but also does a lot<br>for making German students more disgusted with Jews. Hitler adds “race science” to the<br>course of biology to tell students the concept of race. (London Jewish Cultural Centre) At<br>the same time, Hitler gives different names to people of different races. People of pure<br>German origin are called “Aryan”. In school, “Aryan” is not allowed to contact and<br>communicate with “non-Aryan”. (Sigward) In some states of the country, Hitler isolates<br>individuals of Jewish descent and makes them study in separate schools. (John) These<br>actions make German students fully aware that they are different from other races. Moreover,<br>Hitler also makes up fake information to vilify the image of Jews. For example, he believes<br>that Jews are the cause of Germany’s chaos and economic depression. (Graham) He also<br>says that the all most every Jew is Communist: “the Jews established a cruel dictatorship<br>over the Russian people and now try to extend it to the rest of Europe and the rest of the<br>world.” (Graham) Because the students at school have no resources or will to understand<br>real history, they easily believe Hitler’s words. The image of Jews in this generation is<br>collapsed. This hatred of false information continues to the Holocaust. In their minds, these<br>Jews are criminals, so it is right to seize and kill them.<br>Another important point that we should consider is making them have no sympathy.<br>We can see from the words from American educator Gregor Ziemer: A teacher is not spoken<br>of as a teacher (Lehrer) but an Erzieher which means they are more like commands.<br>(Sigward) As physical education is a key course, we can imagine how much physical torture<br>students suffer every day. According to the school time table at that time, about 80% of<br>students get over 3-4 PE class every week with over 40 minutes per class in elementary<br>school time. (Basmat) Such long-term military courses and bad teacher-student relationship<br>let students gradually become callous like professional soldiers. What’s more, according to<br>Gregor Ziemer’s words, “students who are physically weak or who cannot obey and obey<br>absolutely must be expelled from school.” (Sigward) They need to train hard and resist the<br>pressure of being eliminated. The double torture of body and spirit makes students’ minds<br>suffer great trauma in their youth time. Compassion, humanity has long been removed from<br>them.ThisalmostabnormalspiritledthemtomassacretheJewsintheHolocaust.<br>To sum up, Hitler promotes his genocide of Jews through a series of educational<br>reforms. He reduces the richness of the course and a lot of propaganda to brainwash the<br>students, let them solidify their thoughts and achieve 100% loyalty to Hitler. After ensuring<br>the unity of thoughts and absolute loyalty, he publicizes through education that Jews had<br>done all kinds of non-existent evil events to strengthen hate of Jews. Finally, he sets up huge<br>number of physical education courses and strict school rules to militarize all students. So<br>education plays an extremely important role in promoting the Holocaust。</p>

    <title>Short Story</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The invisible man</p>
<p>The audience around me suddenly screamed. I also heard the conversation between the two students near me. </p>
<p>“Why is he suddenly appear on the stage?” One student asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about that, maybe it’s a new way to come on the stage,” The other one answered, “As long as I can hear him sing on the stage, I will cheer for him.”<br>  The boy on the stage clearly saw what was happening. I noticed that the fear in his bloodshot eyes finally subsided, and the tense facial muscles relaxed. His pearly tears flowed from his eyes, and the sunshine smile finally came back to his face again.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Suomaf.” I said to myself. Seeing that he could be seen by the students again, I finally let go of my worries. The strange phenomenon of these days was over.</p>
<p>The boy’s name was Suomaf. He and I were both two students in Erwin high school. Compared with me, Soumaf was much more eye-catching. He was like the only flower on the lawn: his face was bright and white with sharp edges and corners. The thick eyebrows rose a little rebelliously. Under the long and curly eyelashes, a pair of sapphire like bright eyes were inlaid in the eye socket. Lips were as tender as rose petals. On the other hand, He had a great interest and talent for singing. Every time there was a singing activity holding in the school, he always appeared on the stage. As soon as his voice came out in the hall, the room was accompanied by waves of cheers and applause. And I was one of the cheers for him. My name was Lamron and I was a common student in this school. However, I was his best friend and we had known each other since Primary school.</p>
<p>Because of the heavy task of high school study, it was difficult for him to squeeze out time to rehearse all kinds of activities arranged by the teachers. Since grade 11 began, I had found that he slept more and more in class during the day, and often couldn’t control his mood.</p>
<p>He complains more and more about his life now. He is no longer willing to communicate with other people; He is dismissive or dismissive of the teacher’s request; Almost all his talks with his parents ended in a quarrel. Just last Thursday, his discontent finally broke out.</p>
<p>“I really don’t want to be a star on campus anymore,” he shouted to me. “Classmates, teachers and schools all have very high requirements for me. I can’t stand for such pressure any more. Every day, we should not only provide homework samples, but also participate in various activities. Every time there is a small mistake, the teacher says it all the time!”</p>
<p>His eyes were full of fatigue and disappointment. The original two shiny gems had been buried in the dust. Those two petals seemed to have passed their most dazzling moment and withered slowly. Even the hair was tarnished and piled up like withered bushes.</p>
<p>“I have tired with this kind of life now. I do not want to be pay attention to. I hope one body can see me so that I can enjoy my own world.” He said in low voice. Then he raised his feeble hands and waved goodbye to me.</p>
<p>The next morning, he and I met at the school gate as usual. He still looked extremely haggard and depressed.  </p>
<p>“Good morning, Suomaf.” I greeted him warmly. “Do you feel better today? It’s nearly the end of the term. Hold on a little longer. “</p>
<p>“Good morning,” he replied weakly. “I wish I could end this kind of life soon.”</p>
<p>When he was finished speaking, a man hit him hard from back. </p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir?” Suomaf turned discontentedly to look behind him. Surprisingly, the student walked straight past, as if nothing had happened. This made Suomaf angry. He rushed to take the classmate’s arm. However, the student seemed to feel nothing and still walked forward, and Suomaf did not have any effect no matter how hard he tried to pull the student. </p>
<p>I was stunned by this magical phenomenon.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Can’t he see Suomaf? “ I said. “Wait, this student …cannot ‘see’ him?” I reminded what he said yesterday. </p>
<p>“Is his wish has come true? That’s unbelievable.” I said to myself.</p>
<p>I ran to Suomaf and told him what I thought.</p>
<p>“It’s unlikely to happen,” he said with eyes full of doubt. “I want to test it again.”</p>
<p>He chose a student at random and stood in front of him. As a result, the student ran into Suomaf and walked straight on without looking back. Then he tried several more times. He even made faces in front of the security guards, but they didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“It looks like it’s true. I’m invisible.” He couldn’t believe what happened. </p>
<p>“It seems that my wish comes true! I can finally live a normal life,” he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>All day long he was studying this phenomenon. According to his description, only several other friends of him and me could still see him.</p>
<p>On our way home from school, I saw that he had got rid of decadence and despair. He told me he would enjoy this wonderful world. </p>
<p>The only sound on this street was the sound of leaves swaying in the wind. The path which was over hundreds of meters was totally empty and silence, the whole world seemed to be left with him and me. After waving goodbye, I watched him disappear into the silent street, and I have an unknown premonition in my heart.</p>
<p>“There must be something wrong with it,” I said.</p>
<p>I didn’t hear from him until early Sunday morning, I was awakened by the telephone ring. I rubbed my bleary eyes and opened my phone. It was Suomaf.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Suomaf?” I said.</p>
<p>The sound on the other side of the phone took all my sleepiness away.</p>
<p>“Is that Lamron there? That’s great! I am now in big trouble, big trouble!” He cried hysterically. “Do you remember what happened on Friday? Now it’s out of control! Not only the students at school can’t see me, but also other people can’t see me gradually! When I was out shopping on Saturday, I found this problem. Security guards, cashiers and everyone else could not see me! I told my parents about it that day. They tried to ask doctors and friends who used to know me for help, but none of them could see me or remember me!” </p>
<p>His emotions poured down on me like the flood which broken the dyke-dam.</p>
<p>“What’s more, this morning even my parents could not remember either! I heard my parents argued about why there was something in their house that didn’t belong to them – they were my daily necessities! “</p>
<p>When I heard what he said, I completely frozed. I didn’t know what to say to him.</p>
<p>“It’s OK, Suomaf, try to calm down. I’ll figure out a way to help you out. Give me some time to think about it. I will call you later.” I said.</p>
<p> It’s seven o’clock in the morning. The sun might just emerge from the horizon. The world was still shrouded in silky mist. At this time, the outside world seemed so mysterious and oppressive.</p>
<p>I spent the whole morning studying this magical phenomenon. After I had a general idea based on Suomaf’s behavior and thoughts in recent weeks, I called him back.</p>
<p>“Is that Suomaf there?” I asked</p>
<p>“Yes, this is Suomaf speaking. Do you have any suggestions to me?” His voice sounds a little hoarse, perhaps because he cried too much.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have some ideas. I think you’re responsible for all these things happened. Do you remember the time you started to complain about your life stress?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and that has been started for a long time.” </p>
<p>“In my opinion, what you did last couple weeks has created an ‘atmosphere’ which is you do not want to be observed by other people. For instance, you decreased the time you communicate with your classmates and sometimes you do not even respond to them, right? You also tried to avoid talking with teachers. All of these actions created a feeling that you tried to isolated yourself. As a result, people begin to feel this atmosphere so that they do not talk to you. The stronger you want to avoid the people around you, the weaker your sense of presence stays in their mind. When your dissatisfaction reaches the extreme, they may forget you. As the people in our school entre the society, they will bring this atmosphere to others. This may spread faster and faster. Like now.” </p>
<p>“Well, that sounds reasonable.” I heard his tone had softened a lot. </p>
<p>“Then according to your analysis, if I want to go back to my original life, I have to break the atmosphere I created myself?” He asked.</p>
<p>“I think so. You need to show your willingness to your origin life. Do you remember there will be a singing activity on next Monday? It is a chance try whether my method works.”</p>
<p>To my surprise, he showed hesitation.</p>
<p>“Let me consider it for some time.” He faltered in reply.</p>
<p>From his hesitant tone, I knew immediately what he was worried about. In such a critical situation, I decided to point out his problem directly.</p>
<p>“I know that you really like acting. I am sure you know it is normal to have a lot of pressure to make outstanding achievements in your favorite field. You can look at me, suomaf. I’m just an ordinary student. I am struggling getting good grades to apply for university. I’m also under pressure. So I think that since you decide to be a famous singer or star, you have the responsibility to undertake the pressure. This is inevitable. Moreover, if my conjecture is correct, there will be no one remember you in the future. I can’t guarantee that I will remember you forever! Maybe tomorrow I may forget you, too! Wake up, Suomaf! If you don’t break the atmosphere, you will not exist! “ I shouted to him.</p>
<p>Total silence.</p>
<p>“Suomaf? Are you there?” I asked.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“I really want to help you, Suomaf. That’s what all I can do for you. Please have a try, I am the best friend of you.”</p>
<p>“OK.” His voice came from cell phone. “I do not want to die in this way, I still want to be a famous singing star in my future life. The happiest time in my life is when I am singing. I will have a try. Thank you, Lamron. Thank you for saving me.” He said. I could tell the determination from his tone of voice.</p>
<p>“That’s great, my friend. I will I’ll help you write your name on the activity list. Don’t give up this chance.” I said.</p>
<p>Monday afternoon’s event was coming soon, and I encouraged him backstage until he performed.      </p>
<p>“Don’t be nervous, Suomaf. As usual, you will succeed.” I encouraged him. </p>
<p>“Next, we welcome Suomaf and his song <Exist>“ The host said. This song he wrote last two days and he decided to sing it today.</p>
<p> At the beginning, though, everyone looked at the stage confused because they couldn’t see Suomaf. However, the miracle happened. As he became more emotionally engaged, his voice began to appear in the hall. Soon his whole body appeared on the stage. When he appeared, everyone seemed to remember who he was, and the familiar cheers echoed in the hall again.</p>
<p>“My friend lit the last torch for me, help me break the darkness, break myself.” He finished the last sentence and made a deep bow to the audience. </p>
<p>All the spotlights on the ceiling hit him. But what shined more in my eyes than the dazzling lamp was his confident smile and enthusiastic eyes.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>David McClean</strong></p>
<p>In the afternoon, I was lying on the sofa, drinking coffee and reading books about psychology. Such a leisurely afternoon was broken by the telephone. It was a call from my friend George Hadley, he said that his children have some mental problems because he saw the horrible Africa scene in the nursery such as vultures flying in the sky and ferocious Lions. In fact, I had seen his children a year ago. A slight paranoia was shown on these children at that time. However, it was usual for children to have such these emotions. When I heard this message, a bad foreboding appeared in my heart. My hunches and instincts were always very exact. I Know there must be something wrong so that I should visit him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The next morning, I went to George Hadley’s house and walked into the nursery together with him. I had sworn that I come to the real Africa after I entre in. Everything there was so real and I couldn’t help myself praise it technology had created such a miracle: the burning sun in the sky with the flying vulture and two fierce lions. The hot sun seemed to be the flame attached on the furious lions which would jump on us in the next second. I was surprised by the discordant atmosphere and the familiar bad foreboding came over stronger at this time. </p>
<p>‘There must be some problems of your children, have you done something provoke them?’ I said.</p>
<p>‘EMM, yes. I used to refuse to let them travel to New York. And a mouth ago, I closed the nursery to threaten them to do their homework.’ George said.</p>
<p>As a psychologist, I could infer from this room that these children were relying too much on this nursery, they can no longer distinguish reality from illusion. As soon as recently their demands were not satisfied, the motions of hatred, disgust, suffering were all reflected on the image in the nursery. The picture here was created by imagination, and the imagination might come true in the future. I need to remind George about retrieve the situation. </p>
<p>‘George, I suggest that you should close the whole house for a long time immediately take your children go out and have a break, I think let children stay in this house will be a danger for you and Lydia.’ I said to George.</p>
<p>As we went out of the nursery, I found a bloody scarf that belonged to Lydia. “What do these two children want to do?’’ I said silently to myself. </p>
<p>“Perhaps when George shut down the house and spent their holiday, everything would become good afterwards.” I thought.</p>
<p> On the other hand, this situation makes me reconsider the use of technology.</p>
<p> “Where does such a great hatred come from? Is there any kinship still left?” I had to worry about that. The technology was developing faster and faster, people had become crazy about them which leads to the weaken connection between family members. Although machines bring us a lot of convenience, in fact, they do more harm to us. George and Lydia were victims of the technology. Due to parents’ work being down by different machines like shoe lacers, the stoves and the heaters, the role of parents was be replaced. Compared to nursery and other ‘sweet machine’, they are just strangers in children’s mind. That was why so many problems happened. “I will meet you an hour later, George. I will send you to the airport to have a holiday.” I walked out of the house.</p>
<p>“Nothing big should happen in such a short time.” I said to myself.</p>
<p>I returned to that house a moment later. Just as I entered the gate, a pungent smell of blood came to my face. ‘George, are you there?’ To my surprise, I saw the children was sitting in the nursery clinical. I was a little bit worried and fearful. ‘Where are your father and mother?’ I asked. ‘Oh, they’ll be here directly,’ the children looked up with a smile on their lips. Their upturned corners of their mouths made me shiver. Their smile seemed to command the vulture to fly towards me suddenly, and the lion who had just eaten turned his eyes to me. The scarves with blood, the lions just finished eating, strong smell of blood Immediately let me realize what happened. I ran as quickly as possible to the outside and called the policy.</p>
<p>When I saw the children leaving with the police, I turned around, entered the house again and closed every machine in this house. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kim Il Sung’s cult of personality</strong></p>
<p>The person our group choose is Kim Il sung. He was the main leader of the founding of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as well as the founder of the Korean labor party. There were two reasons that made him the leader of North Korea. The first reason was his outstanding performance in the Japanese war. He won many victories with the Chinese army in more than 10 battles, thus gaining the trust and appreciation of the Soviet Union. On February 16, 1942, Kim Il Sung became the first battalion commander, and the Soviet Union awarded him the position of captain. (Britannica, 2009) His excellent command of the army laid the foundation for him to become a leader. The second reason was that Kim Il Sung won the Korean War. He put in more than 260000 soldiers in the war and cooperated with China and the Soviet Union to defeat the United Nations. (Britannica, 2018) The victory of the war made the North Korean people think that Kim Il Sung was an extremely great militarist and outstanding national leader. The Korean people’s worship of Kim Il Sung had reached the peak. After Kim Il Sung gained power, he put forward the basic line of post-war economic construction and vigorously promoted the socialist transformation of production relations in urban and rural areas. (Britannica, 2009) He used the idea of Marxism–Leninism. Kim Il Sung wanted to wipe out the socialist forces in North Korea. Like Stalin, Kim Il Sung began to clean up his opponents and political parties after the Korean War in order to maintain his total control. In 1951, Mu Jong, the leader of Yanan faction, was dismissed on the grounds of “Pyongyang lost” and “ineffective combat”. (Britannica, 2018) In 1956, influenced by Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, Pu Changyu of the Soviet Union and TSE Chianguikku of the Yanan school openly challenged Kim Il Sung. They accused the cult of personality of Kim Il sung. But they didn’t get the support, and then Kim Il Sung wiped out the two opposition parties for this reason. (Sommerlad, 2018) All the regime in North Korea was in his hands.</p>
<p>Compare with Stalin, Kim Il sung acted almost the same as him. First off, both of them used media to do propaganda so that everybody would know their greatness. Kim Il sung made laws that all major publications were to include “words of instruction” from Kim Il-sung and his name must be on the first line. (Sommerlad, 2020) It was the same as Stalin controls the ‘Pravda’. (Wilson, 2) Secondly, both of them gave themselves plenty of honorary names. Kim had the “Sun”, “Heavenly Leader”, “Great chairman” and the “Double Hero Gold Medal”. (Sommerlad, 2018) These kinds of title to strengthen his image of God in the hearts of the people. Thirdly, they all used violence to get rid of their opponents. Many government officials opposed to Kim Il Sung were assassinated, such as TSE chianguikku. He was found dead on the farm in 1961. Stalin created the famous NKVD to assassinate people who said bad word to Stalin. (Wilson 4) The final point was that they all change the official history according to their willing. In Kim Il Sung’s revised history of North Korea, Kim Il Sung came from a long history of leadership. In the process of fighting with Japan, he almost single-handedly defeated the Japanese army (without the help of the Soviet Union and China). Stalin also adapted history. (Sommerlad, 2020) He said “He takes on the mantle of Lenin’s disciple and servant of the party”. (Wilson 11）He declared to the people that he was the contemporary Lenin.</p>

    <title>Space plant plan</title>
    <url>/2020/04/29/Space-plant-plan/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Plan-in-space"><a href="#Plan-in-space" class="headerlink" title="Plan in space"></a>Plan in space</h1><p>Scientists are trying to recreate an Earth-like environment or a <strong>biosphere / mini</strong>-<strong>ecosystem</strong>. There are food webs that exist in a biosphere. You must choose at least 5 types of organisms (at least 3 of them must be plants) other than human beings to maintain the foundation of a mini- ecosystem.</p>
<p>-  <strong>what type of organisms?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Vallisneria Natans (Producer):</strong> Absorb animal waste; Oxygen supply: the greatest function of water and grass. Under the light, the water grass continuously pours oxygen into the water and also into the bottom layer</p>
<p><strong>Dinoflagellate Genus (Producer):</strong> Dinoflagellates are widely distributed in fresh water, brackish water and sea water; Dinoflagellate can reproduce in a large amount in a short period of time, and it is the main bait of marine animals like diatom</p>
<p><strong>Euphausia Genus (Primary Consumer):</strong> Krill is an important bait for many fish and baleen whales; They mainly eat phytoplankton.</p>
<p><strong>Alosa elongata (Secondary Consumer):</strong> Omnivorous animal; Can survive in both fresh and saltwater environments.</p>
<p><strong>Photosynthetic bacteria (Decomposer):</strong> It has strong adaptability and can maintain the ecosystem through large-scale reproduction when the ecosystem is out of balance; It can decompose wastes generated by animals and transform them into simple inorganic substances, which can be released into the environment for the producers to use again</p>
<p>-  <strong>biosphere setting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where?</strong> In water. We would dig a small artificial lake with water proof material between water and the moon surface on the north pole of moon with a sealed, nonopaque greenhouse on the top of it, which is completely sealed and contains oxygen in it. The water can contain some mineral substances that moon soil contains, like iron ion or zinc ion. </p>
<p><strong>Temperature?</strong> The water temperature should be constant, about 17.4 ℃, because all the beings that we choose require a constant temperature around 17.4℃. There will be solar thermostat system in the green house to control the temperature. </p>
<p><strong>Gravity?</strong>  The gravity on moon is about 1/6 of earth gravity, which is around 1.63 N/kg, but our location is at the north pole of moon, which gives a larger gravity than other places on moon. The gravity at the north pole on moon would be between 1.7 N/kg to 1.9 N/kg. Such gravity would be enough for days without wind, but if there are strong storms, water might be blown away, so we have a sealed space for the biosphere so that it would not be affected by wind. </p>
<p><strong>Why this area?</strong> We chose to build an artificial lake at the north pole of moon with a greenhouse on the top of it to create a sealed space. The reason that we chose an artificial lake is that it would be easier for a marine ecosystem to survive since it requires less elements than terrestrial ecosystem. For example, soil must contain nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in order to make it easier for plants to survive. However, in water, all what we need are just sunlight for photosynthesis, oxygen and a complete eco-chain with producer, consumer and decomposer. </p>
<p>-  <strong>materials needed</strong> </p>
<p>Bottom material: Polystyrene foam board. </p>
<p>We’re going to clip the foam board between two layers of rubber membranes. It is one of the three common internal wall insulation materials, which is a white object heated by the heated polystyrene beads containing volatile liquid foaming agent after heating. It can effectively keep the system warm. </p>
<p>Materials around and on top of the greenhouse: Particle Cloud. </p>
<p>Using a few grams of hydrogen to form a particle cloud between two layers of rubber membranes. It can significantly reduce space radiation problems. The hydrogen carried is decomposed into protons and electrons, which are sent to space, forming a plasma cloud around the spacecraft and establishing a power grid to attract the plasma cloud, so as to prevent it from leaving the spacecraft. The particle cloud would maintain its shape when it is electrified, so it must be connected to a solar generator. </p>
<p>Supporting material: Rebar, Screw etc. </p>
<p>-  <strong>soil composition (Earth-like environment)</strong></p>
<p><strong>how to create it? Use Lunar soil and add some nutrition and the composition of water.</strong></p>
<p>a. Direct transporting earth soil, water, and oxygen to the Moon are ineffective and expensive because it takes much space.<br> b. We can produce oxygen and water on the Moon; thus, we do not need to bring that much </p>
<p>from Earth. The steps to make oxygen and water can be roughly divided into the following:<br> 1).  The solar wind is made up of a stream of electrons; thus, when it crosses the surface of th-e Moon, it reacts with proton and creates Hydrogen. Since hydrogen atom is only made up of one proton and one electron, it can be created easily.<br> 2).  Silicon dioxide on the surface of the Moon decomposes and produces silicon and oxygen.<br> 3).  The oxygen and Hydrogen can react and produce water<br> This process can produce not only water but also oxygen, so the oxygen and water problem are solved. </p>
<p><strong>What nutrients, elements, etc. does the soil need?</strong> </p>
<p>a.   Coral sand, coarse sand, gravel sand, dolomite, and other materials are excellent substrate. The gap between these sandmolecules is large, which is conducive to the growth of the </p>
<p>roots of aquatic grass and can keep the water clean, which plays a role in purifying water </p>
<p>quality.</p>
<p>b.   Weak acidic river sand.</p>
<p>c.   The soil must contain some minerals such as C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Mb, Cu, B, and Cl so that Vallisneria natans can grow underwater. Meanwhile, the lunar soil has miner-als like Fe and Zn, so we only need to transport earth soil with remaining missing elements.</p>
<p><strong>How will it be maintained?</strong></p>
<p>-  We build Solar thermostat, water facility and Solar power supply facility</p>
<p>-  In this ecosystem, the aquatic plant(Vallisneria natans) can do photosynthesis and produce oxygen. Dinoflagellate can get energy through photosynthesis and reproduce very fast. They are the food source of euphausiids as well. Then, Alosa can get food from euphausiid. When Alosa dies, the Photosynthetic bacteria can decompose the wreckage of the fish and transform them into pure inorganic substances that can be used by producers again.</p>
<p>-  <strong>Rocket mission logistics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Polystyrene foam board, Particle Cloud (Power up after being assembled), Rebar, Screw, solar panel, electric generator, Nomo-thermal System and living things that we need</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 350 million dollars in total, including equipment and the cost of a single rocket launch. (Falcon heavy launcher)</p>
<p><strong>Mass:</strong> 1420 tones (Take-off weight of rocket)</p>
<p>​                              </p>
<p>-  <strong>Is it better to use smaller rockets and transport many times or a large rocket and transport less times?</strong></p>
<p>For our project, we prefer to use a large rocket and transport less times. Because we do not have so many things to carry and a single trip can perfectly satisfy us. A Felcon Heavy Carrier’s maximum capacity is 60 tones, which is enough for us. Also, our materials for the lake and the greenhouse all have almost permanent shelf life, so we do not need to change materials in a short time.</p>

    <title>MY BIGGEST FAILURE</title>
    <url>/2020/04/11/MY-BIGGEST-FAILURE/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>My experience of Failure</p>
<p>In February 2019, I took part in the WSC debate at Beijing Duwei High School. Although I had had a lot of debating training in junior high school and had participated in relevant competitions, in this competition our group won only one of a total of four competitions. In the debate, we were behind our rivals in terms of language expression, logic, vocabulary range and so on. This event has become the biggest failure in my life.</p>
<p>WSC was my first international debating competition, and also the first time I had talked and competed with foreign students. In order to represent the strongest foreign language school in Nanjing, I prepared for a whole month for the competition. First of all, I studied the hot topics in 2018, such as whether schools should allow homeless people to attend and other social issues. At the same time, I also predicted the problems that would appear in 2019. </p>
<p>However, when our team started to confidently debate, we soon found a lot of fatal error besides the topics. First of all, our debate required us to speak only in English, and in preparation, we hadn’t had enough time to organize our language and come up with more accurate words to express our views. In just one minute, we couldn’t find much evidence to support our argument. What’s more, some of our opponents had strong accents, which made it difficult for us to understand what they were saying. So we lost a lot of points as we couldn’t refute our opponent’s argument. The biggest problem was the range of vocabulary. There were a lot of specialized words that I didn’t know from the large amount of materials we researched, so I wasn’t able to pronounce many words accurately and some sentences were grammatically incorrect. More importantly, I didn’t bring the flu into my speech. Most of the time, I looked at my manuscript and therefore gave my opinions mechanically, lacking a sense of communication with the judges compared with my opponents. I think these are the reasons why I failed.</p>
<p>Although the result of this debate was unsatisfactory, I think this failure has given me a lot of experience and taught me some lessons. In order to achieve better results in this year’s competition, I have improved my spoken English. At the same time, I have also participated in more school debating competitions to practice my spoken English I hope I can do better in this year’s competition and be in the top 20 in the debate awards.</p>
<p> Lessons learnt In the process of participating in debating competitions are not limited just to the debating competition, they can also be applied to our college life and later life. In college life, we have to use English to communicate our own ideas with other students. If we have the ability to speak well , other students will understand our ideas faster. It is the same in the future job search. Fluent expression and clear thinking are essential to get high marks in an interview.</p>

    <title>Opinion about using ESC</title>
    <url>/2020/03/29/Opinion-about-using-ESC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I agree with the third opinion which allows scientists to do experiment with embryos with some limitations. The embryo researches done by scientists have made great contributions in the scientific and medical fields. In the medical field, Scientists have created organ transplants using the properties of embryonic stem cells that can develop into all cells except the placenta. In the future, there is no need for patients to wait for the donor organ anymore. This can greatly increase the survival rate of patients. On the other hand, with the development of embryonic stem cell research, our cloning technology has become more and more advanced. After we can clone complete animals, this technology can be used in many areas. For example, we can save endangered animals by cloning to protect and spread the species resources of animals. Moreover, we can also breed better animals to ensure the reduction of endangered species.</p>
<p>Although these researches play an important role in promoting human development, we still need to pay attention to moral and ethical issues. In my opinion, as the embryos develop, their mortal status increases. By the 14th day of embryonic stem cells’ development, the ‘primitive streak’ begins to appear, which means that the cells have nervous system. As soon as the cells have nervous system, they will have consciousness and sensory feeling which means they have acquired human characteristics. That’s why our world made 14-day role to protect the embryos. On the other hand, I think the field where embryo researches can be applied should also be limited. All researches must be applied to areas that can help people, such as health care, environmental protection and so on. Research for the purpose of harming humans should be considered crime such as the manufacture of poison gas.</p>
<p>In the future, I think IPSC can replace ESC. IPSC is that people make adult cells lose their function and structure to make them into undifferentiated cells. In this process, we can effectively avoid using embryos and other controversial experimental materials. At the same time, IPSC can be widely collected, not like the scarcity of embryo resources. The total cost of the experiments will be much lower if we use IPSC.</p>

    <title>Reflection about NumPhy</title>
    <url>/2020/03/18/Reflection-about-Numpy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After finishing the study of Python language, I started the research of data analysis which is the study of NumPy. Data analysis refers to the use of appropriate statistical analysis methods to analyze a large number of collected data, summarize and understand them, and play the role of data. Because of the large and complex amount of data in our reality, it is very difficult to find out the heterogeneity of these data by our human brain. However, NumPy can help us transform these images into arrays or other forms to present images.</p>
<p>Example one:</p>
<p>This histogram is that we let the computer generate 100 random numbers and then count the number of data distributed in each interval.  This histogram can clearly show the maximum and minimum values of the whole array.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DPKc6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/18/8DPKc6.md.png" alt="8DPKc6.md.png"></a></p>
<p>Example two:</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real-life example. This is a histogram of the height of the president of the United States. Here, we use commands in NumPy to extract the data about the height of the president. When we put all the data in a matrix, it becomes the same as the last example.  We can also do all the operations we want, such as the average value or the maximum and minimum value, when we analyze it according to the chart.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DETpj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/18/8DETpj.md.png" alt="8DETpj.md.png"></a></p>
<p>In the process of learning data analysis, I also encountered many difficulties. The most important problem is that I can’t understand the meaning of some codes. All I have to do is to type the codes in the book mechanically. Although I have studied and looked up these strange and complicated codes after class, there are still some unclear codes. So I will study the other functions of python that we didn’t involve  in class to solve questions.</p>

    <title>POEM 2 REVISING</title>
    <url>/2020/03/14/POEM-2-REVISING/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>‘Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, </p>
<p>Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, </p>
<p>Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs </p>
<p>And towards our distant rest began to trudge. </p>
<p>Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots </p>
<p>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; </p>
<p>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots </p>
<p>Of disappointed shells that dropped behind.’</p>
<p>‘Takh, takh’, the gates of hell have been opened</p>
<p>The locust - like imp pounced on the crowd</p>
<p>Fear, panic, despair was darkened</p>
<p>Blood sputtered; all men died after one pace out. </p>
<p>Arms, legs, helmets with bullet holes, </p>
<p>Screech and shot are inundated with this piece of land. </p>
<p>Rifle, Gatling, ruthless roles, </p>
<p>Nonstop shooting kills the last firebrand.</p>
<p>Death was admiring from the other side of the field</p>
<p>the legendary work he was accomplishing.</p>
<p>winds with offensive smell of blood rolled over the weald</p>
<p>carrying souls of the suffering</p>
<p>The mutilated limbs piled up into black and white bushes</p>
<p>nourished by the blood and resistance</p>
<p>The fire flickered again in his eyes</p>
<p>When hearing the horn in the distance</p>
<p>As he raised hand and slowly dimmed the light,</p>
<p>The cruel sickle had been swung</p>
<p>‘My friend, you would not tell with such high zest </p>
<p>To children ardent for some desperate glory, </p>
<p>The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est </p>
<p>Pro patria mori.’</p>

    <title>Reflections about doing part-time job</title>
    <url>/2020/02/23/Reflections-about-doing-part-time-job/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the first semester of my second year in high school, I had a lot of free time. So I found a famous restaurant in Nanjing as a part-time job. I do eight hours of part-time work every Saturday. My job is to simply deliver food and clear the table. I didn’t think it would be difficult at first. But when it came down to it, it was really painful.</p>
<p>First of all, some guests like to order a lot of food. This made the size of the tableware he used different, which caused me a lot of trouble in cleaning the table. Moreover, some food scraps will be scattered on the table, and I have to clean them carefully with napkins. The second is the workload. Saturday is a time for many people to go out. The restaurant where I work is in the mall, so the population is even greater. There are peaks at noon and at night. I didn’t have time to take a rest in that hour or two. I was working all the time. It’s a very common phenomenon that the desk can’t be cleaned up on time. What makes me tired is that I only have one hour of rest a day, and I have to stand and take care of the guests for the rest of the day. Every time I get off work, my feet ache.</p>
<p>After experiencing the hard work of the working people at the grassroots level in China, I learned how happy I was to be able to go to school. In the service industry, the payment of service personnel is not directly proportional to their wages. They do the same job every day, working late into the night with little pay. In order to avoid this situation in my future, I must study hard, be a mental worker, and make more contributions to the society.</p>
