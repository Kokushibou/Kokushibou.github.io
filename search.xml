    <content><![CDATA[<p>‘Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, </p>
<p>Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, </p>
<p>Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs </p>
<p>And towards our distant rest began to trudge. </p>
<p>Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots </p>
<p>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; </p>
<p>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots </p>
<p>Of disappointed shells that dropped behind.’</p>
<p>‘Takh, takh’, the gates of hell have been opened</p>
<p>The locust - like imp pounced on the crowd</p>
<p>Fear, panic, despair was darkened</p>
<p>Blood sputtered; all men died after one pace out. </p>
<p>Arms, legs, helmets with bullet holes, </p>
<p>Screech and shot are inundated with this piece of land. </p>
<p>Rifle, Gatling, ruthless roles, </p>
<p>Nonstop shooting kills the last firebrand.</p>
<p>Death was admiring from the other side of the field</p>
<p>the legendary work he was accomplishing.</p>
<p>winds with offensive smell of blood rolled over the weald</p>
<p>carrying souls of the suffering</p>
<p>The mutilated limbs piled up into black and white bushes</p>
<p>nourished by the blood and resistance</p>
<p>The fire flickered again in his eyes</p>
<p>When hearing the horn in the distance</p>
<p>As he raised hand and slowly dimmed the light,</p>
<p>The cruel sickle had been swung</p>
<p>‘My friend, you would not tell with such high zest </p>
<p>To children ardent for some desperate glory, </p>
<p>The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est </p>
<p>Pro patria mori.’</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The people among this land should be cheerfully singing</p>
<p>To celebrate the harvest of the past year’s winning</p>
<p>Immersed in winter, winners are singing, the wind is dancing</p>
<p>But who knows, in the heart of this country, the disease is raging</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A ferocious virus do shake this paradise</p>
<p>While thousands of people are dying </p>
<p>Crack, crack……</p>
<p>They crashed the hope, people’s desire, even kids’ dreams</p>
<p>However, Strong people never fear losing their homes</p>
<p>We know the feature of our future will be brighter</p>
<p>Incompetent officials hide at their sad little nest</p>
<p>Greedy businessmen never stop exploiting</p>
<p>Fearless workers build hospitals day and night</p>
<p>Only for the dark clouds hovering over the city to dissipate</p>
<p>At the time when people are running in different way</p>
<p>Brave angel in white goes against the virus with brave</p>
<p>When I behold of the window at the cloud far away</p>
<p>I was annoyed that I can just hide in this cave</p>
<p>And nothing against time’s scythe can make defence</p>
<p>And I have always believed that the dawn will finally come</p>

    <title>Reflections about doing part-time job</title>
    <url>/2020/02/23/Reflections-about-doing-part-time-job/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the first semester of my second year in high school, I had a lot of free time. So I found a famous restaurant in Nanjing as a part-time job. I do eight hours of part-time work every Saturday. My job is to simply deliver food and clear the table. I didn’t think it would be difficult at first. But when it came down to it, it was really painful.</p>
<p>First of all, some guests like to order a lot of food. This made the size of the tableware he used different, which caused me a lot of trouble in cleaning the table. Moreover, some food scraps will be scattered on the table, and I have to clean them carefully with napkins. The second is the workload. Saturday is a time for many people to go out. The restaurant where I work is in the mall, so the population is even greater. There are peaks at noon and at night. I didn’t have time to take a rest in that hour or two. I was working all the time. It’s a very common phenomenon that the desk can’t be cleaned up on time. What makes me tired is that I only have one hour of rest a day, and I have to stand and take care of the guests for the rest of the day. Every time I get off work, my feet ache.</p>
<p>After experiencing the hard work of the working people at the grassroots level in China, I learned how happy I was to be able to go to school. In the service industry, the payment of service personnel is not directly proportional to their wages. They do the same job every day, working late into the night with little pay. In order to avoid this situation in my future, I must study hard, be a mental worker, and make more contributions to the society.</p>
