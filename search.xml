    <title>MY BIGGEST FAILURE</title>
    <url>/2020/04/11/MY-BIGGEST-FAILURE/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>My experience of Failure</p>
<p>In February 2019, I took part in the WSC debate at Beijing Duwei High School. Although I had had a lot of debating training in junior high school and had participated in relevant competitions, in this competition our group won only one of a total of four competitions. In the debate, we were behind our rivals in terms of language expression, logic, vocabulary range and so on. This event has become the biggest failure in my life.</p>
<p>WSC was my first international debating competition, and also the first time I had talked and competed with foreign students. In order to represent the strongest foreign language school in Nanjing, I prepared for a whole month for the competition. First of all, I studied the hot topics in 2018, such as whether schools should allow homeless people to attend and other social issues. At the same time, I also predicted the problems that would appear in 2019. </p>
<p>However, when our team started to confidently debate, we soon found a lot of fatal error besides the topics. First of all, our debate required us to speak only in English, and in preparation, we hadn’t had enough time to organize our language and come up with more accurate words to express our views. In just one minute, we couldn’t find much evidence to support our argument. What’s more, some of our opponents had strong accents, which made it difficult for us to understand what they were saying. So we lost a lot of points as we couldn’t refute our opponent’s argument. The biggest problem was the range of vocabulary. There were a lot of specialized words that I didn’t know from the large amount of materials we researched, so I wasn’t able to pronounce many words accurately and some sentences were grammatically incorrect. More importantly, I didn’t bring the flu into my speech. Most of the time, I looked at my manuscript and therefore gave my opinions mechanically, lacking a sense of communication with the judges compared with my opponents. I think these are the reasons why I failed.</p>
<p>Although the result of this debate was unsatisfactory, I think this failure has given me a lot of experience and taught me some lessons. In order to achieve better results in this year’s competition, I have improved my spoken English. At the same time, I have also participated in more school debating competitions to practice my spoken English I hope I can do better in this year’s competition and be in the top 20 in the debate awards.</p>
<p> Lessons learnt In the process of participating in debating competitions are not limited just to the debating competition, they can also be applied to our college life and later life. In college life, we have to use English to communicate our own ideas with other students. If we have the ability to speak well , other students will understand our ideas faster. It is the same in the future job search. Fluent expression and clear thinking are essential to get high marks in an interview.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The definition of angel became meaningful </p>
<p>The childhood we spend together can’t be more wonderful</p>
<p>When I saw you for the first time</p>
<p>Forever filled with the smell of thyme</p>
<p>You sparkling shone in the night sky like a diamond </p>
<p>But I had no different from millions of grains of sand</p>
<p>And I was just a common boy thin and short</p>
<p>Wore clothes stained with dirt</p>
<p>Now I am different—although still too shy and scared to talk to you</p>
<p>I protected you in the darkness without letting you knew </p>
<p>in the long narrow alley near your home </p>
<p>Your shadow receded into a faint foam </p>
<p>You should marry me because I’m the Mr.Right </p>
<p>Thousands of night, I studied under the dim light </p>
<p>Waited for the moment that I can stand by your side </p>
<p>And now, I can afford you the gleaming Tiffany diamond</p>
<p>My mother also says you will be the best choice of our family </p>
<p>Let her see me get married and have sons quickly</p>
<p>She sacrificed so much to cultivate me alone, and in turn, I should fulfill her wish </p>
<p>We, together, can raise three sons like me——reward parents for their care and nourish </p>
<p>you should marry me, because I know there’s no better choice</p>
<p>So do not hesitate and seize the chance</p>
<p>I’ll be a good father of our kids </p>
<p>Now, make your decision with a wise sense </p>

    <title>Opinion about using ESC</title>
    <url>/2020/03/29/Opinion-about-using-ESC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I agree with the third opinion which allows scientists to do experiment with embryos with some limitations. The embryo researches done by scientists have made great contributions in the scientific and medical fields. In the medical field, Scientists have created organ transplants using the properties of embryonic stem cells that can develop into all cells except the placenta. In the future, there is no need for patients to wait for the donor organ anymore. This can greatly increase the survival rate of patients. On the other hand, with the development of embryonic stem cell research, our cloning technology has become more and more advanced. After we can clone complete animals, this technology can be used in many areas. For example, we can save endangered animals by cloning to protect and spread the species resources of animals. Moreover, we can also breed better animals to ensure the reduction of endangered species.</p>
<p>Although these researches play an important role in promoting human development, we still need to pay attention to moral and ethical issues. In my opinion, as the embryos develop, their mortal status increases. By the 14th day of embryonic stem cells’ development, the ‘primitive streak’ begins to appear, which means that the cells have nervous system. As soon as the cells have nervous system, they will have consciousness and sensory feeling which means they have acquired human characteristics. That’s why our world made 14-day role to protect the embryos. On the other hand, I think the field where embryo researches can be applied should also be limited. All researches must be applied to areas that can help people, such as health care, environmental protection and so on. Research for the purpose of harming humans should be considered crime such as the manufacture of poison gas.</p>
<p>In the future, I think IPSC can replace ESC. IPSC is that people make adult cells lose their function and structure to make them into undifferentiated cells. In this process, we can effectively avoid using embryos and other controversial experimental materials. At the same time, IPSC can be widely collected, not like the scarcity of embryo resources. The total cost of the experiments will be much lower if we use IPSC.</p>

    <title>Reflection about NumPhy</title>
    <url>/2020/03/18/Reflection-about-Numpy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After finishing the study of Python language, I started the research of data analysis which is the study of NumPy. Data analysis refers to the use of appropriate statistical analysis methods to analyze a large number of collected data, summarize and understand them, and play the role of data. Because of the large and complex amount of data in our reality, it is very difficult to find out the heterogeneity of these data by our human brain. However, NumPy can help us transform these images into arrays or other forms to present images.</p>
<p>Example one:</p>
<p>This histogram is that we let the computer generate 100 random numbers and then count the number of data distributed in each interval.  This histogram can clearly show the maximum and minimum values of the whole array.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DPKc6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/18/8DPKc6.md.png" alt="8DPKc6.md.png"></a></p>
<p>Example two:</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real-life example. This is a histogram of the height of the president of the United States. Here, we use commands in NumPy to extract the data about the height of the president. When we put all the data in a matrix, it becomes the same as the last example.  We can also do all the operations we want, such as the average value or the maximum and minimum value, when we analyze it according to the chart.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/8DETpj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/03/18/8DETpj.md.png" alt="8DETpj.md.png"></a></p>
<p>In the process of learning data analysis, I also encountered many difficulties. The most important problem is that I can’t understand the meaning of some codes. All I have to do is to type the codes in the book mechanically. Although I have studied and looked up these strange and complicated codes after class, there are still some unclear codes. So I will study the other functions of python that we didn’t involve  in class to solve questions.</p>

    <title>POEM 2 REVISING</title>
    <url>/2020/03/14/POEM-2-REVISING/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>‘Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, </p>
<p>Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, </p>
<p>Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs </p>
<p>And towards our distant rest began to trudge. </p>
<p>Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots </p>
<p>But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; </p>
<p>Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots </p>
<p>Of disappointed shells that dropped behind.’</p>
<p>‘Takh, takh’, the gates of hell have been opened</p>
<p>The locust - like imp pounced on the crowd</p>
<p>Fear, panic, despair was darkened</p>
<p>Blood sputtered; all men died after one pace out. </p>
<p>Arms, legs, helmets with bullet holes, </p>
<p>Screech and shot are inundated with this piece of land. </p>
<p>Rifle, Gatling, ruthless roles, </p>
<p>Nonstop shooting kills the last firebrand.</p>
<p>Death was admiring from the other side of the field</p>
<p>the legendary work he was accomplishing.</p>
<p>winds with offensive smell of blood rolled over the weald</p>
<p>carrying souls of the suffering</p>
<p>The mutilated limbs piled up into black and white bushes</p>
<p>nourished by the blood and resistance</p>
<p>The fire flickered again in his eyes</p>
<p>When hearing the horn in the distance</p>
<p>As he raised hand and slowly dimmed the light,</p>
<p>The cruel sickle had been swung</p>
<p>‘My friend, you would not tell with such high zest </p>
<p>To children ardent for some desperate glory, </p>
<p>The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est </p>
<p>Pro patria mori.’</p>

    <title>Reflections about doing part-time job</title>
    <url>/2020/02/23/Reflections-about-doing-part-time-job/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the first semester of my second year in high school, I had a lot of free time. So I found a famous restaurant in Nanjing as a part-time job. I do eight hours of part-time work every Saturday. My job is to simply deliver food and clear the table. I didn’t think it would be difficult at first. But when it came down to it, it was really painful.</p>
<p>First of all, some guests like to order a lot of food. This made the size of the tableware he used different, which caused me a lot of trouble in cleaning the table. Moreover, some food scraps will be scattered on the table, and I have to clean them carefully with napkins. The second is the workload. Saturday is a time for many people to go out. The restaurant where I work is in the mall, so the population is even greater. There are peaks at noon and at night. I didn’t have time to take a rest in that hour or two. I was working all the time. It’s a very common phenomenon that the desk can’t be cleaned up on time. What makes me tired is that I only have one hour of rest a day, and I have to stand and take care of the guests for the rest of the day. Every time I get off work, my feet ache.</p>
<p>After experiencing the hard work of the working people at the grassroots level in China, I learned how happy I was to be able to go to school. In the service industry, the payment of service personnel is not directly proportional to their wages. They do the same job every day, working late into the night with little pay. In order to avoid this situation in my future, I must study hard, be a mental worker, and make more contributions to the society.</p>
